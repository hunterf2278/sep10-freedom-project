   * A big electric pen that can use either ink or lead for when you're writing on paper.  
   * You need to refill the storage of lead and ink every week or week and a half 
   * Luckily the electric part of the pen doesn’t need charging
   * This pen has a little screen on it where you can see the words you are writing. 
   * The mistakes that the pen picks up on are grammar errors
   * When you make a grammatical mistake, the screen flashes red to let you know that what you wrote isn’t grammatically correct.
   * If you misspell a word, then the screen will flash blue. 
   * Once the screen is done flashing, it will underline a sentence where the error is, that way, the person knows what's wrong and can try to fix it.
