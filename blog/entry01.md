# Entry 1: Writing
10/8/25

### Content:

The topic that I chose for this project is writing because I have always loved and been passionate about writing. In school, everytime I had a assignent or project of our choosing, I would always choose something that required me to write and use my own imagination. For example, I would write a poem or a continuation journal entry of a story that we read in class. Also, over the years I have written three poems and one narrative,this summer I have written two short stories. Now that you know how much I love to write, you can  easily undestand why I would choose this as my topic. The other topics of my choice were animation and animals, and these are topcis that I am interested in and maybe would like to investigate in future. However, none of these topics excite me as much as writing does. I know that I will have a lot more to talk about in this project, and I will be more motivated if I choose my first topic, so thats what I am going to do. 

There are a couple of websites and articles I am using to give me an idea on how to start the project with my wirting topic. For example, one website I researched is (https://www.go-globe.com/top-technology-tools-for-flawless-writing). I like this website because it shows the different technology used today to help a person improve their writing themself. It also gives me a genreal idea of what technology is already developed so then I won't develop the same thing. Another website is (https://cambridge-research.org/blogs/top-12-best-creative-writing-programs-for-high-school-students/), which is a good website that shows me how technogoy is used to give people information about where they can go to improve. Now, some websites that I could have used for my other topics are...



## Engineering Design Process: 

I am currently in the first and the second stage of this engineering design process, the first part was to choose a topic that we are most passionate about. Then we have to identify a problem, my problem is that people are uneducated or have limited knowledge about the different types of technology, that no one has discovered yet, that could improve a person's writing. The second stage of this process is to use websites and articles to help me research technology that we already have, and tehcnology that could invented to help a young inspired writer. I will also make sure to get feedback from my peers so that I can get a new perspective on the sitiuation, which will help me further refine my research and my overall project.
