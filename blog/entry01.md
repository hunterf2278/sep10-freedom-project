# Entry 1: My topic,Writing and Editing. 
10/8/25


The topic that I chose for this project is Writing and Editing because I have always been passionate about writing. Everytime I had a assignent or project of our choosing, I would always choose somehting that required me to write using my own imagination. For example, I would write a poem or a journal entry continuation of a story tht we read in class. Also, oveer the yearsI have written three poems, one narrative, and two short stories over this summer.
