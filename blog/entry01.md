# Entry 1: Writing
10/8/25

## Content:

The topic I chose for this project is  writing because I have always loved and been passionate about it. In school, whenever I was given an assignment or project where I could choose my own topic, I always chose something that allowed me to write and use my imagination. For example, I’ve written poems and continuation journal entries based on stories we read in class. Over the years, I’ve written three poems and one narrative, and this summer I wrote two short stories. Now that you know how much I love to write, you can easily see why I chose this as my topic. The other topics were animation and animals, those are topics that I am interested in and would like to explore in the future. However, none of them excite me as much as writing does. I know I’ll be more motivated and engaged if I choose writing as my topic, so that's exactly what I’m going to do.

There are a few websites and articles I plan to use to help me get ideas for staring my project. For example, one website I researched is (https://www.go-globe.com/top-technology-tools-for-flawless-writing). I like this website because it shows the different types of technology used today to help a person improve their writing skills. It also gives me a general idea of what tools already exists so I don't end up developing something to similar. Another website is (https://cambridge-research.org/blogs/top-12-best-creative-writing-programs-for-high-school-students/), which shows how technology is used to share information about programs that can help improve a person's writing. Overall, these sources hlped me get a better idea of where to begin with my project. 



## Engineering Design Process: 

I am currently in the first and second stage of the engineering design process, the first stage was to choose a topic that we are most passionate about. Then, we have to identify a problem. The problem I want to solve is that **there are many possibilties of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing**. The second stage of this process involves using websites and articles to research technology that already exsits, and explore new ideas for technology that could be invented to help young aspiring writers. I also plan to get feedback from my peers to gain a new perspective on the sitiuation, which will help me further refine my research and improve my project. 


## Skills: 

Some skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Time management** and **Communication**.

#### Communication:
When I was in the first stage of the engineering design process, I had mixed thoughts about choosing writing as my topic and decided to attend after-school tutoring for Software engineering. I did this so that I could gain feedback and see if writing would be a good topic for me. I knew that I wanted to choose that as my topic, but I needed to ask others if there was enough to write about within that topic to make my project manageable. Going to after-school tutoring turned out to be very helpful because I was given great advice and my teacher even connected me with an author he knows, so I could learn more about the writing process. Because of the guidance and encouragement from the author, I ultimately decided to choose writing as my topic.  Overall, I learned how important it is to use the resources around you and communicate with others, becuase it can help you make better and more efficent decisions. 

#### Time Management:
Another important skill I developed is time management. Over the past week,I had multiple projects and tests to complete and study for, including this blog entry, and it was all very exhausting. I knew it wouldn't be efficient to try to finish everything in one day, so I decided to manage my time wisely and work on a small part of each assignment every day. For example, with my blog entry, on Wednesday I completed the content, on Thursday I worked on the engineering design process part, on Friday I took a break, on Saturday I finished the sources and finally on Sunday I finished the skills section. This allowed me to stay organized, not stress or worry, and still have time to do other important things.

## Summary:
In summary,  I am estatic to continue my research so I can develop a website and introduce to the world, new writing technology.
