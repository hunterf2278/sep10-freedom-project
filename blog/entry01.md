# Entry 1: Writing
10/8/25

## Content:

The topic that I chose for this project is writing because I have always loved and been passionate about writing. In school, everytime I had a assignent or project of our choosing, I would always choose something that required me to write and use my own imagination. For example, I would write a poem or a continuation journal entry of a story that we read in class. Also, over the years I have written three poems and one narrative,this summer I have written two short stories. Now that you know how much I love to write, you can  easily undestand why I would choose this as my topic. The other topics of my choice were animation and animals, and these are topcis that I am interested in and maybe would like to investigate in future. However, none of these topics excite me as much as writing does. I know that I will have a lot more to talk about in this project, and I will be more motivated if I choose my first topic, so thats what I am going to do. 

There are a couple of websites and articles I am going to use to give me an idea on how to start the project. For example, one website I researched is (https://www.go-globe.com/top-technology-tools-for-flawless-writing). I like this website because it shows the different technology used today to help a person improve their writing themself. It also gives me a genreal idea of what technology is already developed so then I won't develop the same thing. Another website is (https://cambridge-research.org/blogs/top-12-best-creative-writing-programs-for-high-school-students/), which is a good website that shows me how technology is used to give people information about where they can go to improve. 



## Engineering Design Process: 

I am currently in the first and the second stage of this engineering design process, the first part was to choose a topic that we are most passionate about. Then we have to identify a problem, the problem that I want to solve is that **there are so many possibilties of unexplored technology which could help improve a person's writing**. The second stage of this process is to use websites and articles to help me research technology that we already have, and tehcnology that could be invented to help a young inspired writer. I will also make sure to get feedback from my peers so that I can get a new perspective on the sitiuation, which will help me further refine my research and my overall project. 


## Skills: 

Some skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Time management** and **Communication**.

#### Communication:
When I was in the first stage of the engineering design process, I at first had many mixed thoughts about my writing topic and I decided to go to  the Wednesday tutoring for Software engineering(SEP). I did this so that I could get feedback from Mr. Mueller and see if writing would be a good topic for me. I knew that I wanted to choose that as my topic, but I needed to ask others to see if there was a lot to explore with that topic, and that way it would make the project easier for me to do. In the end talking to Mr.Mueller helped a lot because he gave me advice and even had me talk to an author he knows so I could learn more and I eneutlllay decided to choose Writing as my topic.  Overall, I learned that its important to use the resources around you and communicate with others, becuase it can help you make better and more efficent decisions. 

#### Time Management:
Another improtant skill that I developed is time management because over this whole week I have had multiple projects and tests to complete and study for, it was all very exhausting. I knew that it would ineffiecnet if I tried to fin9ish everything in one day, so I decided to manage my time wisely and do a small amount of each project or everything each day. For instance with my Blog entry, on Wednesday I would completed the Content, next on Thursday I did the Engineering Design Process part, then on Friday I took a break, and Saturday I finished the Sources and lastly on Sunnday I finished the Skills section.  This allowed me to managme my time so I wasn't procrastinating and I had time to do other important things, and not be so stressed or worried.
