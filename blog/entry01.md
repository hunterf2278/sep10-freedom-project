# Entry 1: Writing
10/8/25

## Content:

The topic I chose for this project is  writing because I have always loved and been passionate about it. In school, whenever I was given an assignment or project where I could choose my own topic, I always chose something that allowed me to write and use my imagination. For example, I’ve written poems and continuation journal entries based on stories we read in class. Over the years, I’ve written three poems and one narrative, and this summer I wrote two short stories. Now that you know how much I love to write, you can easily see why I chose this as my topic. The other topics were animation and animals, those are topics that I am interested in and would like to explore in the future. However, none of them excite me as much as writing does. I know I’ll be more motivated and engaged if I choose writing as my topic, so that's exactly what I’m going to do.

There are a couple of websites and articles I am going to use to give me an idea on how to start the project. For example, one website I researched is (https://www.go-globe.com/top-technology-tools-for-flawless-writing). I like this website because it shows the different technology used today to help a person improve their writing themselves. It also gives me a genreal idea of what technology is already developed so then I won't think of developing something similar. Another website is (https://cambridge-research.org/blogs/top-12-best-creative-writing-programs-for-high-school-students/), which is a good website that shows me how technology is used to give people information about where they can go to improve. All in all this helped me get a general idea of where to start with my project. 



## Engineering Design Process: 

I am currently in the first and the second stage of this engineering design process, the first part was to choose a topic that we are most passionate about. Then we have to identify a problem, the problem that I want to solve is that **there are so many possibilties of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing**. The second stage of this process is to use websites and articles to help me research technology that we already have, and tehcnology that could be invented to help a young inspired writer. I will also make sure to get feedback from my peers so that I can get a new perspective on the sitiuation, which will help me further refine my research and my overall project. 


## Skills: 

Some skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Time management** and **Communication**.

#### Communication:
When I was in the first stage of the engineering design process, I at first had many mixed thoughts about my writing topic and decided to go to  the Wednesday tutoring for Software engineering(SEP). I did this so that I could get feedback from Mr. Mueller and see if writing would be a good topic for me. I knew that I wanted to choose that as my topic, but I needed to ask others to see if there was a lot to explore with that topic, and that way it would make the project easier for me to do. In the end talking to Mr.Mueller helped me a lot because he gave me advice and even had me talk to an author he knows, so I could learn more and becuase of this great influence, I eventually decided to choose Writing as my topic.  Overall, I learned that its important to use the resources around you and communicate with others, becuase it can help you make better and more efficent decisions. 

#### Time Management:
Another improtant skill that I developed is time management because over this whole week I have had multiple projects and tests to complete and study for,including the blog entry, and it was all very exhausting. I knew that it would inefficent if I tried to finish everything in one day, so I decided to manage my time wisely and do a small amount of everything each day. For instance with my Blog entry, on Wednesday I completed the content, next on Thursday I did the engineering design process part, then on Friday I took a break, and Saturday I finished the sources and lastly on Sunday I finished the skills section. This allowed me to have time to do other important things, and not be so stressed or worried.
