# Entry 1:Writing and Editing. 
10/8/25

Content:
The topic that I chose for this project is writing and editing because I have always loved and been passionate about writing. In school, everytime I had a assignent or project of our choosing, I would always choose something that required me to write and use my own imagination. For example, I would write a poem or a continuation journal entry of a story that we read in class. Also, over the years I have written three poems and one narrative,this summer I have written two short stories. Now that you know how much I love to write, you can  easily undestand why I would choose this as my topic. The other topics of my choice were animation and animals, and these are topcis that I am interested in and maybe would like to investigate in future. However, none of these topics excite me as much as writing does. I know that I will have a lot more to talk about in this project, and I will be more motivated if I choose my first topic, so thats what I am going to do. 

Some of my sources are...

The second stage of this process is too research
