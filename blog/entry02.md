# Entry 2: Writing

## Content:
I have finally finished my research and learned about the different softwares and hardware that writers can use. For example, one  I found was [Scrivener](https://scrivener.app/).  I found it by searching "Writing apps."  Scrivener has a lot of helpful features like letting you organize your writing, publish or export your work, and even track how many  times you use certain words so you don’t repeat yourself too much. Another website I discovered by searching "What are some software that writers use for writing?" was the website [Dabblewriter](https://www.dabblewriter.com/). This site allows you to plan out the different parts of your story, which makes it easier to remember what happens next. It can also read your writing out loud so you can catch your mistakes or awkward sentences. Plus, you can leave yourself notes as you write, which is great for remembering changes you want to make later. 

To find different types of hardwares, I searched on Google  for"writing hardware" and found a website called [Distraction-Free-Writing-Devices](https://kadavy.net/distraction-free-writing-devices/) . It showed me a lot of cool devices and tools. One of them was called the [Freewrite](https://getfreewrite.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopuxMTi52KrlPe-I2sVPK2BBgXrVgg_jrMpEmKl-yApBsx6fI6Q). What stood out to me is that its screen is designed to be easy on your eyes, unlike regular computer screens that can cause the eye to strain. It also  has a long-lasting battery, so you can write for longer periods of time without needing to charge it. There are even different versions, like the Freewrite Traveler, Freewrite Smart Typewriter, and Freewrite Alpha. The other hardware I found was the [BYOK](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byok/byok-the-ultimate-distraction-free-writing-tool), this one was my favorite. It helps you stay focused and improve your writing because there are no distractions, no apps, no notifications, and no extra interruptions. The BYOK isn't attached to a computer, so you can move it around and write in any comfortable position. When you're comfortable, it's easier to stay focused and enjoy writing. It's also small and portable, this allows you to take your work and inspiration with you wherever you want to go.

## Engineering Design Process: 
We just finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we researched different kinds of hardware and software that are already developed, and could help young writers. The next stage requires me to brainstorm new ideas for technology that doesn't exist yet, but could further improve kid's writing and even make it more fun. This stage will help me work toward solving my main problem, that there are many possibilities of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing.

## Skills: 
The two main skills I have learned when starting this blog and project are **How to Google** and having a **Growth Mindset**.

#### How to Google:
When I was researching the different existing software, I searched "Writing Apps" and I found a website called Scrivener which gave me a lot of helpful information. However, as I kept using that search, I kept getting the same result over and over again. So, I changed my search to  "What software that people in writing use?" and I found a completely different website called Seven Writing Tools for Authors. Overall, this taught me how to properly search on google in order to get more useful results.

#### Growth Mindset:
I used a growth mindset during my research because I got frustrated and tired at times  since I didn't know what details I should write down, and I honestly felt like giving up. But I stopped myself, I took a break, went on a walk to get away from the computer. When I came back, I decided to write down the details I found important. I finished my reasearch and was proud of myself. I learned that sometimes, all you need is patience and persistence in order to find the answer yourself, instead of just giving up.

## Summary:
I look forward to continuing to work on my Freedom project and eventually create my own website. Though what I'm most excited about is using my imagination to come up with new technology that can be invented to help writers like myself, I can't wait!!
