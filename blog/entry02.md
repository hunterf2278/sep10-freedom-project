# Entry 2: Writing

## Content:
I have finally finished my research and learned about the different softwares and hardware that writers can use. For example, one  I found was [Scrivener](https://scrivener.app/).  I found it by searching "Writing apps."  Scrivener has a lot of helpful features like letting you organize your writing, publish or export your work, and even track how many  times you use certain words so you don’t repeat yourself too much. Another website I discovered by searching "What are some software that writers use for writing?" was the website [Dabblewriter](https://www.dabblewriter.com/). This site allows you to plan out the different parts of your story, which makes it easier to remember what happens next. It can also read your writing out loud so you can catch your mistakes or awkward sentences. Plus, you can leave yourself notes as you write, which is great for remembering changes you want to make later. 

Now, in order to find different hardwares, I searched in google "Writing hardware" and found a webite called [Distraction-Free-Writing-Devices](https://kadavy.net/distraction-free-writing-devices/) which helped me learn about many diiferent types. One hardware was the [Freewrite](https://getfreewrite.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopuxMTi52KrlPe-I2sVPK2BBgXrVgg_jrMpEmKl-yApBsx6fI6Q). One function of this device that stood out to me was that the device display is concentration friendly and visually comfortable, unlike computer screens which can strain the eye. Another function is that this device has a longer lasting battery so you can write for longer periods of time. Lastly, there are many types of Freewrite's, such as a Freewrite Traveler, Freewrite Smart Typewriter, and Freewrite Alpha. The other hardware I reasearched was the [BYOK](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byok/byok-the-ultimate-distraction-free-writing-tool). This was my favorite device because it has tools to improve your writing virtually, and physically. For instance, the BYOK has no apps, no notifactions, and no distractions which allows people to focus more on their writing. The BYOK isn't physcially attached to a computer, you can move it into any viewing postion that's comfortable for you, and if your comfortable then you can have more fun writing while relaxing. Finally, the Byok has a portable and compact design that is easy to carry, this allows you to take your work and inspiration with you wherever you want to go.

## Engineering Design Process: 
We have just currently finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we had to research different types of hardware and software that were already developed and could help young inspired writers. The next stage after this is stage three, which requires me to brainstorm the possibilities of technology that doesn't exist, but could help further improve kids' writing. This will help me solve my problem that there are many possibilities of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing.

## Skills: 
The skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **How to Google** and a **Growth Mindset**.

#### How to Google:
When I was researching the different existing software, I searched up "Writing Apps" and I found a website known as Scrivener and I got a lot of information from it which was very helpful. However, as I kept using that search, I couldn't find any new and interesting websites or apps. So, I decided to change what I was searching, instead of just using "Writing Apps" I searched up "What is some software that people in writing use?" and I managed to find another interesting website known as Seven Writing Tools for Authors. Overall, this taught me how to properly search on google in order to get more results.

#### Growth Mindset:
I had a growth mindset because when I was doing my research, I was frustrated and tired because I wasn't sure what details from the apps I should take notes of. I felt like giving up, however, I stopped myself. I decided to calm myself down and take a break, go on a little walk, get away from the computer, then come back and continue to persevere through it. Once I came back, I sat and thought about just writing down the details I find important from the website. Eventually, I finished and was satisfied with my notes and proud of myself. I learned that sometimes, all you need is patience and persistence in order to find the answer yourself, instead of just giving up.

## Summary:
I look forward to continuing my Freedom project and eventually creating my own website. Though what I am excited for is the chance to  use my own imagination to think of new technology that can be invented to help writers just like myself, I can't wait!!
