# Entry 2: Writing

## Content:
I have finally finished my research and learned about the different softwares and hardware that writers can use. For example, one  I found was [Scrivener](https://scrivener.app/).  I found it by searching "Writing apps."  Scrivener has a lot of helpful features like letting you organize your writing, publish or export your work, and even track how many  times you use certain words so you don’t repeat yourself too much. Another website I discovered by searching "What are some software that writers use for writing?" was the website [Dabblewriter](https://www.dabblewriter.com/). This site allows you to plan out the different parts of your story, which makes it easier to remember what happens next. It can also read your writing out loud so you can catch your mistakes or awkward sentences. Plus, you can leave yourself notes as you write, which is great for remembering changes you want to make later. 

To find different types of hardwares, I searched on Google  for"writing hardware" and found a webite called [Distraction-Free-Writing-Devices](https://kadavy.net/distraction-free-writing-devices/) . It showwled me a lot of cool devices and tools. One of them was called the [Freewrite](https://getfreewrite.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopuxMTi52KrlPe-I2sVPK2BBgXrVgg_jrMpEmKl-yApBsx6fI6Q). What stood out to me is that its screen is designed to be easy on your eyes, unlike regular computer screens that can cause the eye to strain. It also  has a long-lasting battery, so you can write for longer periods of time without needing to charge it. There are even different versions, like the Freewrite Traveler, Freewrite Smart Typewriter, and Freewrite Alpha. The other hardware I found was the [BYOK](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byok/byok-the-ultimate-distraction-free-writing-tool), this one was my favorite. It helps you stay focused and improve your writing because there are no distractions, there are no apps, no notifications, and no extra interruptions. The BYOK isn't attached to a computer, so you can move it around and write in any comfortable position. When you're comfortable, its easier to stay focused and enjoy writing. It's also small and portable, this allows you to take your work and inspiration with you wherever you want to go.

## Engineering Design Process: 
We have just currently finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we had to research different types of hardware and software that were already developed, and could help young inspired writers. The next stage after this is stage three, which requires me to brainstorm the possibilities of technology that doesn't exist, but could help further improve kids' writing. This will help me solve my problem that there are many possibilities of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing.

## Skills: 
The skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **How to Google** and a **Growth Mindset**.

#### How to Google:
When I was researching the different existing software, I searched up "Writing Apps" and I found a website known as Scrivener and I got a lot of information from it. However, as I kept using that search, I couldn't find any interesting websites. So, I decided to change what I was searching, instead of just using "Writing Apps" I searched up "What is some software that people in writing use?" and I managed to find another interesting website known as Seven Writing Tools for Authors. Overall, this taught me how to properly search on google in order to get more results.

#### Growth Mindset:
I had a growth mindset because when I was doing my research, I was frustrated and tired because I wasn't sure what details from the apps I should take notes of. I felt like giving up, however, I stopped myself. I decided to calm myself down and take a break, go on a little walk, get away from the computer, then come back and continue to persevere through it. Once I came back, I sat and thought about just writing down the details I find important from the website. Eventually, I finished and was satisfied with my notes and proud of myself. I learned that sometimes, all you need is patience and persistence in order to find the answer yourself, instead of just giving up.

## Summary:
I look forward to continuing my Freedom project and eventually creating my own website. Though what I am excited for is the chance to  use my own imagination to think of new technology that can be invented to help writers just like myself, I can't wait!!
