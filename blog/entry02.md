# Entry 2: Writing

## Content:
I have finlaly finished my research and learned about the many unique softwares and hardwares that is accesible to apsiring writers all around the world. For example, one software was a website called [Scrivener](https://scrivener.app/) which I found after searching "Writing apps." This app has many different tools you can use, such as a publishing and exporting writing tool. It can also make simple corrections or restruct all your paragaphs so they're better organized. Adding on, it can track the amount of times you use certain words, that helps you make sure you aren´t reusing words often, and if so, you can make substitutions. Another website I found after searching "What are some software that writers use for writing?" was a website known as [Dabblewriter](https://www.dabblewriter.com/). This app allows you to map out every arc in your story so its easier for you to remember, understand, and then incoporate into your story. In additon, the app can read your paragraphs to you, in order to help correct your phrasing and catch mistakes. Finally, It allows you to leave notes when writing your story in this website so that you can remember to make small improvements.

Now, in o order to find different hardwares, I searched in google "Writing hardware" and found a webite called [Distraction-Free-Writing-Devices](https://kadavy.net/distraction-free-writing-devices/) which helped me learn about many diiferent types. One hardware was the [Freewrite](https://getfreewrite.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopuxMTi52KrlPe-I2sVPK2BBgXrVgg_jrMpEmKl-yApBsx6fI6Q). One function of this device that stood out to me was that the device display is concentration friendly and visually comfortable, unlike computer screens which can strain the eye. Another function is that this device has a longer lasting battery so you can write for longer periods of time. The other hardware I reasearched was the [BYOK](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byok/byok-the-ultimate-distraction-free-writing-tool). This was my favorite device because it has tools to improve your writing virtually, and physically. For instance, the BYOK has no apps, no notifactions, and no distractions which allows people to focus more on their writing. Lastly, the BYOK isn't physcially attached to a computer, you can move it into any viewing postion that's comfortable for you, and if your comfortable then you can have more fun writing while relaxing.  

## Engineering Design Process: 
We have just currently finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we had to research different types of hardware and software that were already developed and could help young inspired writers. The next stage after this is stage three, which requires me to brainstorm the possibilities of teachnology that doesn't exsist, but could help further improve kids writing. This will help me solve my problem that there are many possibilties of unexplored technology, that could help improve a person's writing.

## Skills: 
The skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **How to Google** and a **Growth Mindset**

#### How to Google:
When I was researching the different exsisting software, I searched up "Writing Apps" and I found a website known as Scrivener and I got a lot of information from it which was very helpful. However, as I kept using that search, I coudln't find any new and interesting websites or apps. So, I decided to change what I was searching, instead of just using "Writing Apps" I searched up "What is some software that people in writing use?" and I manged to find another interesting website known as Seven Writing Tools for Authors.  Overall, this taught me how to properly search on google in order to get more results. 

#### Growth Mindset:
I had a growth mindset because when I was doing my research, I was frustrated and tired because I wasn't sure what details from the apps I should take notes of. I felt like giving up, however, I stopped myself. I decided to calm myself down and take a break, go on a little walk, get away from the computer, then come back and continue to preservere through it. Once I came back,  I sat and thought about just writing down the details I find important from the website. Eventually, I finished and was satisfied with my notes and proud of myself. I learned that sometimes, all you need is patience and persistance in order to find the answer yourself, instead of just giving up. 

## Summary:
I look forward to continuing my Freedom project and eventually creating my own website. Though what I am excited for is the chance to  use my own imagination to think of new technologythat can be invented to help writes just like myself, I can't wait!!
