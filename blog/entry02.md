## Content:
After I did my research I have learned that there are many unique softwares and hardwares that is accesible to apsiring writers all around the world. For example, one software was an app called Scrivener which I found after searching "Writing apps", this app has many different tools you can use such as publishing and exporting your writing, it can make simple corrections or restruct all your paragaphs so its better organized. Also, it can track amoutn of times you use certain words, that helps you make sure you aren´t reusing words often, and if so, you can make substitutions. Another website I found after searching "What are some software that writers use for writing?" was a website known as Dabblewriter. This app allows you to map out every arc in your story so its easier for you to remember, understand. and then incoporate into the story. In additon the app can read your paragraphs to you, in order to help correct your phrasing and catch mistakes.


## Engineering Design Process: 
We have just currently finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we had to research different types of hardware and software that were already developed and could help young inspired writers. The next stage after this is stage three, which is that I need to brainstorm the possibilities of teachnology that doesn't exsist, but could help kids further improve their writing. This will help me solve my problem that there are many possibilties of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing.

## Skills: 
The skills that I have learned when starting this blog and project are **How to Google** and...

#### How to Google:
When I was researching the different exsisting software that supports writers today, I searched up "Writing Apps" and I found a website known as Scrivener and I got a lot of information from it which was very helpful. Howver, as I kept using that search, I coudln't find any new and intersting software. So, I decided to change what I was searching, instead of just using "Writing Apps" I searched up "What is some software that people in writing use?" and I manged to find another interesting website known as Seven writign tools for authors.  Overall, this taught me how to properly search for stuff on google in order to get more different results.
