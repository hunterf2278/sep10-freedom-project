# Entry 3: Writing
##### 12/1/25

## Content:
I have brainstormed two different inventions or physical technology that hasn't been invented but it could help writers in the future.
My first invention was called the Scanner, this scans people's devicesw and gives them comments  about how they could improve their writing. It can also see if someone used Ai, whether it was for their whole writing piece or only a sentence. My next invention was called the Word Pen which is an electric pen with a screen on it, that shows you if you made a grammatical mistake or mispelled a word. I came up with these ideas by thinking of things that I struggle with myself, as a student and writee. The main problem I thought of was editing my work, for example, I miss the errors I make or I'm not aware that certain things wee errrors. So if I invented tools that could help students and teachers with these problems, it would make things simpler and encourage them to write more. 

Now,  I finalized all of my content by organzing my information about exsiting technology into sections. The first section was Software, such as websites or apps, and next was hardware such as innovations. I did this because it was easy to identify the different stuff I found in my research and it would be easier for those reading my website to understand. Then for Part B, brainstorming my own technology, all I had to do was organize it into one section,  hardware. All of my ideas were innovations and hardware, so it was simple and easier to categorize it that way. 


## Engineering Design Process:

We have just finished stage 3 of the engineering design process. Stage 3 was when we had to brainstom different types of technogloy that could improve or be helpful to the topic we chose. For example, I brainstormed different hardware that people could use to edit their writing. This hardware could make writing more enjoyable for teens and encourage them to continue. 


## Skills: 

The two main skills I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Embracing Failure** and having a **Organization**.


### Embracing Failure

### Organization

## Summary:
I look forward to continuing to work on my Freedom project and finally creting my own website. Now that I have finished all of my research and content, its finally time to work on making and designing a website, i'm super excited.
