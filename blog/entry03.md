# Entry 3: Writing
##### 12/2/25

## Content:
I have brainstormed two different inventions or physical technology that hasn't been invented but it could help writers in the future.
My first invention was called the Scanner, this scans people's devicesw and gives them comments  about how they could improve their writing. It can also see if someone used Ai, whether it was for their whole writing piece or only a sentence. My next invention was called the Word Pen which is an electric pen with a screen on it, that shows you if you made a grammatical mistake or mispelled a word. I came up with these ideas by thinking of things that I struggle with myself, as a student and writee. The main problem I thought of was editing my work, for example, I miss the errors I make or I'm not aware that certain things wee errrors. So if I invented tools that could help students and teachers with these problems, it would make things simpler and encourage them to write more. 


## Engineering Design Process:

We have just finished stage 3 of the engineering design process. Stage 3 was when we had to brainstom different types of technogloy that could improve or be helpful to the topic we chose. For example, I brainstormed different hardware that people could use to edit their writing. This hardware could make writing more enjoyable for teens and encourage them to continue. 


## Skills:
