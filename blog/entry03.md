##### X/X/XX

We just finished stage 2 of the engineering design process. Stage 2 was when we researched different kinds of hardware and software that are already developed, and could help young writers. The next stage requires me to brainstorm new ideas for technology that doesn't exist yet, but could further improve kid's writing and even make it more fun. This stage will help me work toward solving my main problem, that there are many possibilities of unexplored technology that could help improve a person's writing.
