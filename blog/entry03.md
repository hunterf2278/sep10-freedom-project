# Entry 3: Writing
##### 12/1/25

## Content:
I have brainstormed two different inventions or physical technology that hasn't been invented but it could help writers in the future.
My first invention was called the Scanner, this scans people's devicesw and gives them comments  about how they could improve their writing. It can also see if someone used Ai, whether it was for their whole writing piece or only a sentence. My next invention was called the Word Pen which is an electric pen with a screen on it, that shows you if you made a grammatical mistake or mispelled a word. I came up with these ideas by looking at [previous freedom projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A9c3MeOK8fK8ylRY06DXC-QLbdJjKKj4lvDp-UHlbHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) that past students did, for example I looked at the 11th grader [Brianna's project](https://briannap6399.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/final-project/), she did the same topic as me so this heled me gain inspiration on what I could add ro or base my invention off of, I was also thinking of things  I struggle with as a student and writer. The main problem I thought of was editing my work, for example, I miss the errors I make or I'm not aware that certain things were errrors. So if I invented tools that could help students and teachers with these problems, it would make things simpler and encourage them to write more. 

Now,  I finalized all of my content by organzing my information about exsiting technology into sections. The first section was Software, such as websites or apps, and next was hardware such as innovations. I did this because it was easy to identify the different stuff I found in my research and it would be easier for those reading my website to understand. Then for Part B, brainstorming my own technology, all I had to do was organize it into one section,  hardware. All of my ideas were innovations and hardware, so it was simple and easier to categorize it that way. 


## Engineering Design Process:

We have just finished stage 3 of the engineering design process. Stage 3 was when we had to brainstom different types of technogloy that could improve or be helpful to the topic we chose. For example, I brainstormed different hardware that people could use to edit their writing. This hardware could make writing more enjoyable for teens and encourage them to continue. 


## Skills: 

The two main skills I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Embracing Failure** and having a **Organization**.


### Embracing Failure:

When we were doing a gallery walk in class to show off our ideas for new inventions, I recieved many compliemnts and constructive critism. Some the comments forced me to rethink my idea which honestly made me feel a little dissapointed that some parts of my idea didn't make sense.  However, I refused to get discouraged and decided to use the feedback I got to improve my original idea, also I even used that feedback to create another idea for an invention.  

### Organization:

I learned organization when I was organizing my exsiting technology reasearch. I had to think of what organization technique would make things easier for me and the people reading my future website to understand. For example, I thought about organizing my exsisting technology research by using a timeline. All my inventions had different years they were founded so it would be simple, but I already drafted my information into two sections of software and hardware innovations. I decided to do that because I  belived that a timeline with a mix of hardware and software would be  a bit confusing for people, so seperating these types of technology would be easier. 


## Summary:
I look forward to continuing to work on my Freedom project and now that I have finally finished all of my research and content, it's time to work on making and designing my own website. I'm super excited!!
