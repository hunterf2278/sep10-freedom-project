# Entry 3: Writing
##### 12/1/25

## Content:
I  finished brainstorming inventions that could exist  in the future to help writers. My first invention is called the Scanner, this device scans your writing and gives you feedback on how to improve it. It can also know if someone used AI, whether it was for their whole piece or a sentence. My next invention is the Word Pen, it’s an electrical pen with a screen that shows you if you made a grammatical mistake or misspelled a word. I came up with these ideas by looking at [previous freedom projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A9c3MeOK8fK8ylRY06DXC-QLbdJjKKj4lvDp-UHlbHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) from other SEP10 students. For instance, I looked at my friend [Brianna’s project](https://briannap6399.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/final-project/), she did writing as her topic as well so this helped me gain inspiration on what I could add to or base my inventions off of. I also thought of the things I struggle with as a student and writer. The main issue was editing my work. Sometimes I miss errors or I don’t realize that some things are wrong. So I wanted to invent tools that could help students and teachers with those problems. I think these inventions would make writing a lot easier and maybe encourage people to write more. 

I finished organizing all of my content by putting my information about existing technology into sections. The first section was software, such as websites or apps, and second was hardware such as devices or innovations. I organized it this way because it made it easier to understand my research, and it would be clearer for those reading my website to understand. Then for the ideas I had for my own technology, all I had to do was organize it into one hardware section. All of my ideas were innovations and hardware, so it was easier to categorize it that way. 


## Engineering Design Process:

We  just finished stage 3 of the engineering design process. Stage 3 was about brainstorming our own types of technology that could improve or help with the topic we chose. In my case, my invention can be used to edit writing.  The next stage is where I start designing my website by using all the HTML and CSS I’ve learned over the past few months.  I feel like I am even closer to solving my problem, that there are still so many possibilities of unexplored technology which could help improve a person's writing.


## Skills: 

The two main skills I have learned when starting this blog and project are **Embracing Failure** and having a **Organization**.


### Embracing Failure:

When we did a gallery walk in class to show off our ideas for new inventions, I received many compliments but also some constructive criticism. Some of the comments forced me to rethink my idea, which honestly felt a little disappointing, but made me realize that some parts of my idea didn't make sense.  However, I refused to get discouraged and decided to use the feedback to improve my original idea. I also used the feedback to create another idea for an invention.  Overall, I learned to not get discouraged  instead, value the criticism I receive and use that to make my work better. 


### Organization:

I learned a lot about organization while putting together my existing technology research. I had to figure out which organizing technique would make the most sense for me and for the people who would read my website. At first, I thought about organizing my existing technology research by using a timeline, since my inventions were done in different years.  That could have worked, but I already drafted my information into two sections of software and hardware innovations. I decided to stick with that because I  believed that a timeline with a mix of hardware and software would be a bit confusing, so separating them would be easier.  This showed me that there are many ways to organize information, and you need to prioritize the one that would make it easier for people to comprehend. 


## Summary:
I look forward to continuing to work on my Freedom Project! Now that I have finally finished with all my research and content, it's time to work on creating and designing my website. I'm super excited and can’t wait!
